Blink Vision

If computer users don't blink enough while working, they often suffer from eye strain, dry eyes, itchy eyes and other problems associated with Computer Vision Syndrome.
As per the 20-20-20 rule, looking at an object placed 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes promotes better eye health.
Ideal blink rate for a healthy adult is between 15-20 blinks per minute. 

Blink Vision is an application that offers a solution for this problem. 
This Python based application runs in the background and monitors a user's blink rate via their webcam.
Blink Vision uses facial landmarks and Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect and count the user's blinks. 
If the user's average blink rate for a given duration is lesser than 15-20 blinks per minutes, Blink Vision notifies the user to take a break via a Windows toast message.
